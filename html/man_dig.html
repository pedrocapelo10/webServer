			<P>       dig - DNS lookup utility</P>
			<P>SYNOPSIS</P>
			<P>       dig  [  @server ]  [ -b address ]  [ -c class ]  [ -f
			filename ]  [ -k       filename ]  [ -p port# ]  [ -t type ]  [ -x addr ]  [ -y

			<P>       dig [ global-queryopt... ]  [ query... ]</P>
			<P>DESCRIPTION</P>
			<P>       dig  (domain  information groper) is a flexible tool for
			interrogating       DNS name servers. It performs DNS lookups  and  displays
			 the  answers       that  are returned from the name server(s) that were
			queried. Most DNS       administrators use dig to troubleshoot DNS  problems 
			because  of  its       flexibility,  ease  of  use  and clarity of output.
			Other lookup tools       tend to have less functionality than dig.</P>
			<P>       Although dig is normally used with command-line
			arguments, it also has       a  batch  mode of operation for reading lookup requests
			from a file. A       brief summary of its command-line arguments  and 
			options  is  printed       when  the  -h  option  is  given.   Unlike earlier
			versions, the BIND9       implementation of dig allows multiple lookups to be 
			issued  from  the       command line.</P>
			<P>       Unless  it  is told to query a specific name server, dig
			will try each       of the servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf.</P>
			<P>       When no command line arguments or options are given,
			will  perform  an       NS query for &quot;.&quot; (the root).</P>
			<P>       It  is  possible  to set per user defaults for dig via
			${HOME}/.digrc.</P>
			<P>       This file is read and any options in it are applied
			before the command       line arguments.</P>
			<P>SIMPLE USAGE</P>
			<P>       A typical invocation of dig looks like:</P>
			<P>        dig @server name type</P>
			<P>       where:</P>
			<P>       server is the name or IP address of the name server to
			query. This can              be an IPv4  address  in  dotted-decimal  notation
			 or  an  IPv6              address  in  colon-delimited notation. When the
			supplied server              argument is a hostname, dig resolves that name
			before  querying that name server. If no server argument is 
            provided, dig consults /etc/resolv.conf and  queries  the  name 
			servers  listed              there.  The  reply  from  the name server that
			responds is displayed.</P>
			<P>       name   is the name of the resource record that is to be
			looked up.</P>
			<P>       type   indicates what type of query is required — 
			ANY,  A,  MX,  SIG,              etc.   type can be any valid query type. If no
			type argument is              supplied, dig will perform a lookup for an A
			record.</P>
			<P>OPTIONS</P>
			<P>       The -b option sets the source IP address of the query to
			address. This       must be a valid address on one of the host’s network
			interfaces.</P>
			<P>       The  default  query  class  (IN  for internet) is
			overridden by the -c       option. class is any valid class, such as HS for Hesiod
			records or  CH       for CHAOSNET records.</P>
			<P>       The  -f  option  makes dig  operate in batch mode by
			reading a list of       lookup requests to process from the file filename. The
			file contains a       number  of  queries,  one  per  line. Each entry in the
			file should be       organised in the same way they would be presented as 
			queries  to  dig       using the command-line interface.</P>
			<P>       If a non-standard port number is to be queried, the -p
			option is used.       port# is the port number that dig will send its queries
			instead of the       standard  DNS port number 53. This option would be used
			to test a name       server that has been configured to listen for queries on
			 a  non-stan       dard port number.</P>
			<P>       The  -t  option sets the query type to type. It can be
			any valid query       type which is supported in BIND9. The default query type
			 &quot;A&quot;,  unless the -x option is supplied to indicate a 
            reverse lookup. A zone transfer can be requested by specifying a type of AXFR. When
			an incremental       zone  transfer  (IXFR) is required, type is set to
			ixfr=N.  The incremental zone transfer will contain the changes made to
			the  zone  since       the serial number in the zone’s SOA record was N.</P>
			<P>       Reverse  lookups  - mapping addresses to names - are
			simplified by the       -x option. addr is an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal 
			notation,  or  a       colon-delimited  IPv6  address.  When this option is
			used, there is no       need to provide the name, class and type arguments. dig 
			automatically       performs  a  lookup  for a name like
			11.12.13.10.in-addr.arpa and sets       the query type and class to PTR and IN respectively. By
			default,  IPv6       addresses are looked up using the IP6.ARPA domain and
			binary labels as       defined in RFC2874. To use the older RFC1886 method
			using the  IP6.INT       domain and &quot;nibble&quot; labels, specify the -n
			(nibble) option.</P>
			<P>       To sign the DNS queries sent by dig and their responses
			using transaction signatures (TSIG), specify a TSIG key file using
			the  -k  option.       You can also specify the TSIG key itself on the command
			line using the       -y option; name is the name of the TSIG key and key is
			the actual key.       The  key  is  a base-64 encoded string, typically
			generated by dnssec-keygen(8).  Caution should be taken when using the -y
			option on multi-user  systems as the key can be visible in the output
			from ps(1) or in       the shell’s history file. When using TSIG
			authentication with dig, the       name  server  that is queried needs to know the key and
			algorithm that       is being used. In BIND, this is done by providing
			appropriate key  and       server statements in named.conf.</P>
			<P>QUERY OPTIONS</P>
			<P>       dig  provides  a number of query options which affect
			the way in which       lookups are made and the results displayed. Some of
			these set or reset       flag  bits  in  the query header, some determine which
			sections of the       answer get printed, and others determine the timeout and
			retry strategies.</P>
			<P>       Each  query  option is identified by a keyword preceded
			by a plus sign       (+). Some keywords set or reset an option. These may  be
			 preceded  by       the  string  no  to negate the meaning of that keyword.
			Other keywords       assign values to options like the timeout interval. They
			have the form +keyword=value.  The query options are: </P>
			<P>       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       +[no]tcp<br>
            Use  [do  not  use] TCP when querying name
			servers. The default              behaviour is to use  UDP  unless  an  AXFR  or 
			IXFR  query  is              requested, in which case a TCP connection is
			used.</P>
			<P>       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       +[no]vc<br>
            Use [do not use] TCP when querying name servers.
			This alternate              syntax to +[no]tcp is provided for backwards
			compatibility. The              &quot;vc&quot; stands for &quot;virtual circuit&quot;.</P>
			<P>       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       +[no]ignore<br>
            Ignore  truncation  in  UDP  responses instead of
			retrying with              TCP. By default, TCP retries are performed.</P>
			<P>       +domain=somename<br>
            Set the search list to contain the single domain 
			somename,  as              if  specified  in  a  domain directive in
			/etc/resolv.conf, and              enable search list processing as if  the  +search
			 option  were              given.</P>
			<P>       +[no]search<br>
            Use  [do  not use] the search list defined by the
			searchlist or              domain directive in resolv.conf (if any).  The
			search  list  is              not used by default.</P>
			<P>       +[no]defname<br>
            Deprecated, treated as a synonym for +[no]search</P>
			<P>       +[no]aaonly<br>
            This option does nothing. It is provided for
			compatibility with              old versions of dig where  it  set  an 
			unimplemented  resolver              flag.</P>
			<P>       +[no]adflag<br>
            Set  [do not set] the AD (authentic data) bit in
			the query. The              AD bit currently has a standard meaning only in
			responses,  not in queries, but the ability to set the bit in the 
            query is provided for completeness.</P>
			<P>       +[no]cdflag<br>
            Set [do not set] the CD (checking disabled) bit
			in  the  query.              This  requests  the  server to not perform DNSSEC
			validation of              responses.</P>
			<P>       +[no]recurse<br>
            Toggle the setting of the RD (recursion  desired)
			 bit  in  the              query.   This  bit  is set by default, which
			means dig normally              sends recursive queries. Recursion  is 
			automatically  disabled              when the +nssearch or +trace query options are
			used.</P>
			<P>       +[no]nssearch<br>
            When this option is set, dig attempts to find the
			authoritative              name servers for the zone containing the name
			being  looked  up              and  display  the  SOA record that each name
			server has for the              zone.</P>
			<P>       +[no]trace<br>
            Toggle tracing of  the  delegation  path  from 
			the  root  name              servers  for  the  name being looked up. Tracing
			is disabled by              default. When tracing is enabled,&nbsp; dig makes 
			iterative  queries              to  resolve  the name being looked up. It will
			follow referrals              from the root servers, showing the answer from
			each server that              was used to resolve the lookup.</P>
			<P>       +[no]cmd<br>
            toggles the printing of the initial comment in
			the output identifying the version of dig and the query options
			that have been              applied. This comment is printed by default.</P>
			<P>       +[no]short<br>
            Provide a terse answer. The default is to print
			the answer in a              verbose form.</P>
			<P>       +[no]identify<br>
            Show [or do not show] the IP address and port
			number that  supplied  the  answer  when the +short option is
			enabled. If short              form answers are requested, the default  is  not 
			to  show  the              source  address and port number of the server
			that provided the              answer.</P>
			<P>       +[no]comments<br>
            Toggle the display of comment lines in the
			output. The  default              is to print comments.</P>
			<P>       +[no]stats<br>
            This  query option toggles the printing of
			statistics: when the              query was made, the size of the reply and so  on.
			 The  default              behaviour is to print the query statistics.</P>
			<P>       +[no]qr<br>
            Print  [do not print] the query as it is sent. 
			By default, the              query is not printed.</P>
			<P>       +[no]question<br>
            Print [do not print] the question section of a 
			query  when  an answer is returned. The default is to print the 
            question section as a comment.</P>
			<P>       +[no]answer<br>
            Display [do not display] the answer section  of 
			a  reply.  The              default is to display it.</P>
			<P>       +[no]authority<br>
            Display  [do not display] the authority section
			of a reply. The              default is to display it.</P>
			<P>       +[no]additional<br>
            Display [do not display] the additional  section 
			of  a  reply.              The default is to display it.</P>
			<P>       +[no]all<br>
            Set or clear all display flags.</P>
			<P>       +time=T<br>
            Sets the timeout for a query to T seconds. The
			default time out              is 5 seconds.  An attempt to set T to less than 1
			 will  result              in a query timeout of 1 second being applied.</P>
			<P>       +tries=T<br>
            Sets  the  number  of times to retry UDP queries
			to server to T              instead of the default, 3. If T is less than or
			equal to  zero,              the number of retries is silently rounded up to
			1.</P>
			<P>       +ndots=D<br>
            Set  the number of dots that have to appear in
			name to D for it              to be considered absolute. The default value  is 
			that  defined              using the ndots statement in /etc/resolv.conf, or
			1 if no ndots              statement is present. Names with fewer dots are
			interpreted  as              relative  names  and will be searched for in the
			domains listed              in the search or domain directive in
			/etc/resolv.conf.</P>
			<P>       +bufsize=B<br>
            Set the UDP message buffer size advertised  using
			 EDNS0  to  B              bytes.  The  maximum and minimum sizes of this
			buffer are 65535              and 0 respectively. Values outside this range are
			rounded up or              down appropriately.</P>
			<P>       +[no]multiline<br>
            Print records like the SOA records in a verbose
			multi-line format with human-readable comments. The default is
			to print  each              record  on  a single line, to facilitate machine
			parsing of the              dig output.</P>
			<P>       +[no]fail<br>
            Do not try the next server  if  you  receive  a 
			SERVFAIL.  The              default  is  to not try the next server which is
			the reverse of              normal stub resolver behaviour.</P>
			<P>       +[no]besteffort<br>
            Attempt to display the contents of messages which are malformed.  The default is to not display malformed
			answers.</P>
			<P>       +[no]dnssec<br>
            Requests  DNSSEC  records  be sent by setting the
			DNSSEC OK bit              (DO) in the OPT record in the additional section
			of the  query.</P>
			<P>MULTIPLE QUERIES</P>
			<P>       The BIND 9 implementation of dig  supports specifying
			multiple queries       on the command line (in addition  to  supporting  the 
			-f  batch  file       option).  Each  of  those  queries can be supplied with
			its own set of       flags, options and query options.</P>
			<P>       In this case, each query argument represent an
			individual query in the       command-line syntax described above. Each consists of
			any of the standard options and flags, the name to be looked up,  an 
			optional  query       type  and  class  and any query options that should be
			applied to that       query.</P>
			<P>       A global set of query options, which should be applied
			to all queries,       can  also  be  supplied.  These  global query options
			must precede the       first tuple of name, class, type, options, flags,  and 
			query  options       supplied  on  the  command  line. Any global query
			options (except the       +[no]cmd option) can be overridden by a query-specific 
			set  of  query       options. For example:</P>
			<P>       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       dig +qr www.isc.org any -x 127.0.0.1 isc.org ns +noqr</P>
			<P>       shows  how  dig  could  be  used  from  the command line
			to make three       lookups: an ANY query for www.isc.org, a reverse lookup 
			of  127.0.0.1       and  a  query for the NS records of isc.org.  A global
			query option of       +qr is applied, so that dig shows the initial query it
			made  for  each       lookup.  The final query has a local query option of
			+noqr which means       that dig will not print the initial query when  it 
			looks  up  the  NS       records for isc.org.</P>
