			<P>       host  [  -aCdlnrTwv ]  [ -c class ]  [ -N ndots ]  [ -R
			number ]  [ -t       type ]  [ -W wait ]  name [ server ]</P>
			<P>       The -a (all) option is equivalent to setting the -v
			option and asking       host to make a query of type ANY.</P>
			<P>       When  the  -C  option  is  used,  host will attempt to
			display the SOA       records for zone name from all the listed authoritative 
			name  servers       for  that  zone. The list of name servers is defined by
			the NS records       that are found for the zone.</P>
			<P>       The -c option instructs to make a DNS query of class
			class.  This can       be  used  to  lookup Hesiod  or  Chaosnet class
			resource records. The       default class is IN (Internet).</P>
			<P>       Verbose output is generated by host when the -d or -v
			option is  used.</P>
			<P>       The  two options are equivalent. They have been provided
			for backwards       compatibility. In previous versions, the -d option
			switched on debugging traces and -v enabled verbose output.</P>
			<P>       List mode is selected by the -l option. This makes host
			perform a zone       transfer for zone name. The argument  is  provided  for compatibility       with  older  implementations.  This  option  is
			equivalent to making a       query of type AXFR.</P>
			<P>       The -n option specifies that reverse lookups of IPv6
			addresses should       use the IP6.INT domain and &quot;nibble&quot; labels as
			defined in RFC1886. The       default is to use IP6.ARPA and binary labels as defined
			in RFC2874.</P>
			<P>       The -N option sets the number of dots that have to be in 
            name for it       to be considered absolute. The default value is that
			defined using the       ndots statement in /etc/resolv.conf, or 1 if  no ndots 
			statement  is       present.  Names  with fewer dots are interpreted as
			relative names and       will be searched for in the domains listed in  the 
			search  or  domain       directive in /etc/resolv.conf.</P>
			<P>       The  number  of UDP  retries  for a lookup can be
			changed with the -R       option. number indicates how many times host will repeat
			a query  that       does  not  get answered. The default number of retries
			is 1. If number       is negative or zero, the number of retries will default
			to 1.</P>
			<P>       Non-recursive queries can be made via the  -r  option.  
			Setting  this       option clears the RD — recursion desired — bit in
			the query which host       makes.  This should mean that the name server receiving
			the query will       not  attempt  to resolve name. The -r option enables
			host to mimic the       behaviour of a name server by making non-recursive
			queries and expecting  to receive answers to those queries that are
			usually referrals to       other name servers.</P>
			<P>       By default host uses UDP when making queries. The -T
			option  makes  it       use  a TCP connection when querying the name server. TCP
			will be automatically selected for queries that require it, such as
			zone  transfer       (AXFR) requests.</P>
			<P>       The  -t  option  is  used  to  select the query type. 
			type can be any       recognised query type: CNAME, NS, SOA, SIG, KEY, AXFR, 
			etc.  When  no       query  type  is  specified,  host automatically selects
			an appropriate       query type. By default it looks for A records, but if 
			the  -C  option       was given, queries will be made for SOA records, and if
			name is a dotted-decimal IPv4 address or colon-delimited IPv6 
			address,  host  will       query for PTR records.</P>
			<P>       The  time  to wait for a reply can be controlled through
			the -W and -w       options. The -W option makes host wait for wait seconds.
			 If  wait  is       less  than  one,  the  wait interval is set to one
			second. When the -w       option is used, host will effectively wait forever for 
			a  reply.  The       time to wait for a response will be set to the number of
			seconds given       by the hardware’s maximum value for an integer
			quantity.</P>
