<P>DESCRIPTION</P>
<P>       named is a Domain Name System (DNS) server, part of the
BIND 9 distribution from ISC. For more information on the DNS, see
RFCs 1033, 1034, and 1035.</P>
<P>       When invoked without arguments, named will read the default
configuration file /etc/named.conf, read  any  initial  data,  and 
listen  for        queries.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>OPTIONS</P>
<P>       -c config-file<BR>              Use  config-file  as  the 
configuration  file  instead  of the default, /etc/named.conf. To
ensure that reloading the configuration  file continues to work after
the server has changed itsworking directory due to to a possible
directory option in  theconfiguration file, config-file should be an
absolute pathname.</P>
<P>       -d debug-level<BR>              Set the daemon’s debug
level to debug-level.  Debugging  traces from named become more
verbose as the debug level increases.</P>
<P>       -f     Run the server in the foreground (i.e. do not
daemonize).</P>
<P>       -g     Run  the  server  in  the  foreground  and force all
logging to stderr.</P>
<P>       -n #cpus<BR>              Create #cpus worker threads to
take advantage of multiple CPUs. If  not  specified,  named  will try
to determine the number of CPUs present and create one thread per
CPU.  If it is unable to determine  the  number  of CPUs, a single
worker thread will be created.</P>
<P>       -p port<BR>              Listen for queries on port port.
If not specified, the  default is port 53.</P>
<P>       -s     Write memory usage statistics to stdout on exit.<BR>
             Note:  This  option  is mainly of interest to BIND 9
developers and may be removed or changed in a future release.</P>
<P>       -t directory<BR>              chroot() to directory after
processing the command  line  arguments, but before reading the
configuration file.</P>
<P>              Warning:  This option should be used in conjunction
with the -u option, as chrooting a process running as root doesn’t 
enhance security  on most systems; the way chroot() is defined allows
a process with root privileges to escape a chroot jail.</P>
<P>       -u user<BR>              setuid() to user after completing
privileged  operations,  such as creating sockets that listen on
privileged ports.</P>
<P>              Note: On Linux, named uses the kernel’s capability
mechanism to drop all root privileges except the  ability  to  bind()
 to  a privileged  port  and  set  process  resource limits. 
Unfortunately, this means that the -u option only works when named 
is run  on kernel 2.2.18 or later, or kernel 2.3.99-pre3 or later,
since previous kernels did not allow privileges to be  retained after
setuid().</P>
<P>       -v     Report the version number and exit.</P>
<P>       -x cache-file<BR>              Load data from cache-file
into the cache of the default view.</P>
<P>              Warning:  This  option must not be used. It is only
of interest to BIND 9 developers and may be removed or changed in a 
future              release.</P>

</P>
<P>SIGNALS<BR>       In  routine operation, signals should not be
used to control the name server; rndc should be used instead.</P>
<P>       SIGHUP Force a reload of the server.</P>
<P>       SIGINT, SIGTERM<BR>              Shut down the server.</P>
<P>       The result of sending any other signals to the server is
undefined.</P>

<P>CONFIGURATION</P>
<P>       The named configuration file is too  complex  to  describe 
in  detail here.  A  complete description is provided in the BIND 9
Administrator Reference Manual.</P>

</P>
<P>FILES<BR>       /etc/named.conf<BR>              The default
configuration file.</P>
